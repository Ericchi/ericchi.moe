# Ericchi suggests... OSes!

## My favorites
So, I don't think I'm autistic, but if I were, my fixation would probably be operating systems. Here's some of my favorites:
- [Debian](https://debian.org): I use it on all of my computer that need to be online for prolonged periods of time and those that I don't want to worry about. It's solid like a rock and updates always go smooth. It's perfect for servers!
- [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/): It's a perfect compromise between Debian's stability and other Linux distributions that sometimes cause some problems because of their bleeding-edge updates. It's really comfy to use on home computers and it's supported by RedHat, an enterprise almost as big as Fedora's community.
- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (btw): It's really not an operating system for beginners and it's easy to have some issues with it, but if you decide to sacrifice your social life you get to choose and single-handedly install every single component to create an environment that is truly yours. It became viral ~~because memes~~ because of the creativity you can unleash with it.

## Those good in the olden days
Here's some retro operating system that I like to suggest even today because they are still fascinating somehow:
- Windows 7: The last Windows before its decline. It doesn't contain bad surprises, it isn't bloated and if only it was still supported it would be capable of doing whatever modern Windows does in the current days.
- Windows 98 Second Edition: The amount of personalizations of the desktop you can come up to is astonishing. It's a really nostalgic OS and its integration with DOS makes it maybe the best operating system for playing last millennium's games.
- MacOS 9: Everything I said about Windows 98's personalization applies here too, and this old version of MacOS is really loved by the community too. There's also a [secret apple garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/) where you can download a ton of software for old MacOS.

## Those that will curse your computer
Come on, it wouldn't be me if I didn't complain on something about computers. So, here the list of those OSes I hate and I would only touch them from within an isolated virtual machine:
- Windows 8 and 8.1: Horrible, aesthetically unpleasing, privacy invasive and terrible to operate with mouse and keyboard.
- Windows 10: Here the privacy invasion gets even worse. It tries to fix some usability issue that Windows 8 brought in, but the new "metro" apps like that terrible new "Settings" app really had to go.
- Windows 11: Not only its version, but also its issues here are turned up to 11. It doesn't bring anything new, really and in some ways it's even worse than Windows 10. It's burdened with stupid ideas, nonsensical hype for AIs and it also manages to be the most bloated operating system in existence.
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com): I feel it got inspired by Windows: sometimes it gets some really stupid new feature like the Snap package manager.
- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/): A failed attempt of being an Arch Linux for beginners. Its developers have proven many times that they are not fit for the project and the operating system is an unstable mess that could potentially break itself while updating. It's infamous because something bad about Manjaro happens almost once per year.

## Those that exist because of course they do
No comment here.
- [osakaOS](https://leechplus.neocities.org/projects/osakaOS): An operating system built upon <ruby>大阪<rt>Osaka</rt></ruby> from <ruby>あずまんが<rt>Azumanga</rt></ruby><ruby>大王<rt>Daioh</rt></ruby>. Its programmer love her so much that he created an OS just for her, where all the routines to manage system resources are voluntarily nonsensical and inefficient but functional.
- [TETRIS-OS](https://github.com/lucianoforks/tetris-os): As its name states, it's an operating system that just boots up a Tetris game.
