# My favorite websites
These websites are important to me because they made me feel something, or maybe it's because they are hidden gems that I want people to know more of. Making websites is something that everyone could do, but transmitting emotions through them is something special.

## Indie websites
These websites are made by individuals that like to express themselves through their creations. Traveling through webrings I encountered some of them, but these are my favorite ones:
- [plasticdino](https://plasticdino.neocities.org/): The rainbowy website of a girl who really like plastic dinosaurs. She also has [a shrine](https://plasticdino.neocities.org/dinoparks) with photos and images of them.

## Graveyard
These websites don't exist anymore and I miss them a lot. Their disappearance took away a precious piece of the internet and the least I can do is remembering them here.
- <ruby>プーペ<rt>poupé</rt></ruby><ruby>ガール<rt>girl</rt></ruby>: An online flash game where you had to dress a poupé (a living doll) differently every day. You could make a widget with your poupé and place it on your website or in your forum signature.

&nbsp;

Work in progress. I'll add more websites later.
