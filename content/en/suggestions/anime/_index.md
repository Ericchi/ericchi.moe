# Anime that I really like
Anime are the best form of TV content and I really think they should replace those boring TV shows with real people doing real stuff. These are some of my favorite anime:

- [Strawberry Panic](https://myanimelist.net/anime/855/Strawberry_Panic): I don't think this one comes as a surprise. This is my absolute favorite anime. I love it. I love the emotions it makes me feel, I love the Étoile, I love Astraea Hill, I love watching it tens of times on repeat. I love everything about this anime. I love it so much that I even made an Italian translation that [you can find here](https://t.me/EricchiFansub/106).
- [Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka★Magica): I adore magical girls, in particular when the majokko anime genre gets totally subverted, like in this case. Certain delicate issues are dealt with perfectly and both the graphic style and the music are just sublime.
- [Artiswitch](https://myanimelist.net/anime/49066/Artiswitch): An unexpected surprise of a short anime that really took my heart. Each one of its 6 episodes is just 8 minutes long, but those minutes are used perfectly. The anime is about a witch that lures lost artists in her shop and tries to make them understand what to do to make them find their way in life.
- [Chobits](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59/Chobits): An alternative universe where computers are not boxes on desks but humanoids accompanying humans in their everyday lives. The anime focuses on a special computer named Chii and it explores romantic themes from a really unusual point of view.
- [Happy Sugar Life](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37517/Happy_Sugar_Life): Ań̴̪ absolutely norm̴̲͐al anime that tells the sto̵̠̒ry of a really norma̴l girl and her not spec̵̡͛ial at all roomm̶̳̈́ate.
- [Konohana Kitan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35241/Konohana_Kitan): Before reaching the afterlife, souls need to undertake a very long journey, and if they feel tired, there's an inn that can offer some relief. The anime is about the workers who live in that inn, but the customers often have really touching stories to tell.
