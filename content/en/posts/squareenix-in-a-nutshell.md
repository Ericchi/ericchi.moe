- There are four crystals and they maintain the world's balance. They are sacred and worshipped as if they were deities.
- The crystals fall into some chaos and a party of four adventurers go on an adventure to save them. This implies many side quests and resolving the problems of many troubled villages along the way.
- The root cause of the chaos is found and a "final" quest begins: it must be eradicated.
- (not always) There are various bad ending that happen if the player doesn't realize that there's more than the previous "root cause".
- Turns out that the real root cause of the crystals chaos is something bigger that no one noticed and then a REAL final quest starts.
- (not always) "[insert root cause's name here] is not evil... it's just lonely and desperate..."
- The real calamity gets defeated and the world goes on, more aware of problems it never got to think about before.

... and that's why I like them so much.
