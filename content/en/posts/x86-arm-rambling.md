I regret making this scribble. 2022 me didn't know that eventually 2024 would turn that fantasy of mine into the worst possible scenario, filled with corporate greed and AI crap.

&nbsp;

That's all. There's nothing to see here.

I am so sad for everyone who just want to buy a computer without knowing much and instead gets sold something terrible and locked down.
