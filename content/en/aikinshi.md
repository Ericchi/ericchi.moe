<h1>AI LLMs are not welcome here</h1>

This website utilizes technologies that make AI scraping and training difficult, expensive or outright damaging to the trained model if used on its contents. The use of these technologies should not impact the browsing experience for humans.

This is deliberate and should be standard practice for websites on the indie web.

&nbsp;

The reason for this is because the author is strongly against the use of mainstream datacenter-based AI LLMs since they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzsLbHoNXTs" target="_blank">cause brain-rust</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9d0p96N1iw" target="_blank">kill creativity</a> and destroy the planet with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-8TDOFqkQA" target="_blank">resource-intensive activity that requires an unsustainable amount of electricity</a>.

&nbsp;

If you are using an AI LLM like ChatGPT to summarize or extract data from this website, you will most likely be deceived by its "I-know-everything" attitude, because it should only be able to retrieve a limited amount of its data from external sources like search engines and not directly from the website. I am sorry for that, because I believe that it could have been a great feature for accessibility.
