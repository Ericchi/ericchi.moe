<h1>AI LLMs are not welcome here</h1>

This website utilizes technologies that make AI scraping and training difficult, expensive or outright damaging to the trained model if used on its contents. The use of these protective technologies should not impact the browsing experience for human beings who humanly visit the website from a web browser on a device shaped for humans.

This is deliberate and should be standard practice for websites on the indie web.

&nbsp;

The reason for this is because mainstream datacenter-based AI LLMs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzsLbHoNXTs" target="_blank">cause brain-rust</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9d0p96N1iw" target="_blank">kill creativity</a> and destroy the planet with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-8TDOFqkQA" target="_blank">resource-intensive activity that requires an unsustainable amount of electricity</a>.

&nbsp;

Thank you for understanding and thank you again in advance if you decide to reduce or stop your datacenter-based AI LLM usage. I do think the so-called "AI revolution" has potential, but only if it's under your control, self-hosted on your home devices and better yet if they use clean renewable energy.
