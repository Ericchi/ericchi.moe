# Things I programmed
<div class="photo photo-right desktop-only-right-sidebar norecolor"><img class="image content" alt="Trick or Treat House - Title Screen" src="/images/screenshots/tpp-tricktreathouse.webp"></div>

- I've been in the [TwitchPlaysPokemon](https://twitch.tv/TwitchPlaysPokemon) dev team since 2017 and I worked on **\<censored project\>** and [Pokémon TriHard Emerald](https://github.com/tustin2121/trihard-emerald), two fan-made games that went live on TPP's Twitch channel. I also made the title screen for [Pokémon Trick or Treat House](https://github.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/trick-or-treat-house/), that you can see here on the right.
- Between the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023 I went to an online school organized by [Generation](https://generation.org) and I learned a lot about .NET and C#. You can see the projects I realized [here](https://github.com/DOITA07-Ericchi).
