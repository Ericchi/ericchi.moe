# Websites I made

- A blog and some minor projects that were lost when I migrated to new servers. I never restored them because hosting them correctly is a hassle.
- This one, obviously, but putting here a link that points to this website would be redundant to say the least.
- Majotachi no Sub ([the 2022 version](https://web.archive.org/web/20230415190507/https://majotachinosub.com/), before the redesign made by someone else.
- [Ochakai Translations](https://www.ochakaitranslations.com), a website that hosts some fan-made italians translations. I built it with a friend of mine.
