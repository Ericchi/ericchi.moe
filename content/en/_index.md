# Gokigenyō!

Hello, Ericchi here!

&nbsp;

I welcome you to my virtual diary. This is my personal website and in the "[Scribbles](posts/)" section I post whatever comes to my mind that I'd like to share with the world.

&nbsp;

<div class="drawing"><img alt="Pencil-drawn Ericchi" class="image desktop-only-right-sidebar" style="background-clip: content-box; shape-outside: polygon(30% 34%, 7% 20%, 30% 0, 71% 0, 86% 18%, 87% 43%, 100% 48%, 73% 100%, 36% 100%, 36% 69%, 0 61%, 3% 50%);" src="/images/portrait.webp" onerror='this.onerror = null; this.src="images/portrait.png"'></div>

In the Internet world I don't have a well-defined shape, but [a friend of mine](https://www.facebook.com/mathelt.6) sketched me up and I can confirm that my physical form is something similar to the drawing on the right if you are visiting from a desktop/tablet or up here if you are visiting from a smartphone.

The dress that I'm wearing in the drawing is actually in my closet and it has a very special meaning to me.

Talking about dresses, I like to wear lolita ones! In particular sailor and classic ones, even though in my everyday life I wear pajamas or worse.

&nbsp;

I like everything that's magic, like majokkos and I think that computers are great magic catalyzers, because information technology is the kind of magic that I like to use the most to express my creativity.

&nbsp;

In my free time I like to watch anime, play videogames and when I want to be productive I study the language of rising sun. My favorite videogames are RPGs and sometimes I play [Pokémon (both VGC and TCG)](https://www.pokemon.com/play-pokemon/) competitively!
